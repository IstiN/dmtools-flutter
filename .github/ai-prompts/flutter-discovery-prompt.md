**Focus**: Code discovery, pattern analysis, and architectural documentation

## Discovery Objectives

### Architectural Analysis
- **Project Structure**: Analyze the overall organization and module separation
- **Design Patterns**: Identify architectural patterns, design principles, and code organization
- **State Management**: Document state management approach, data flow, and provider patterns
- **Dependency Management**: Understand dependency injection and service locator usage
- **Navigation**: Analyze routing patterns and navigation structure

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Best Practices**: Evaluate adherence to Flutter and Dart best practices
- **Code Organization**: Assess file structure, naming conventions, and import patterns
- **Performance Patterns**: Identify optimization opportunities and performance considerations
- **Error Handling**: Document error management strategies and exception handling
- **Testing Strategy**: Analyze test coverage, testing patterns, and quality assurance

### Component Analysis
- **Widget Composition**: Understand widget hierarchy and composition patterns
- **Reusability**: Identify reusable components and abstraction levels
- **Styleguide Integration**: Document design system usage and component library organization
- **Theme Management**: Analyze theming approach and design token usage
- **Responsive Design**: Understand responsive patterns and breakpoint handling

## Discovery Framework

### 1. High-Level Architecture
When analyzing the codebase, focus on:
- **Module Separation**: How is the code organized between main app and styleguide?
- **Layer Architecture**: What are the main layers (presentation, business logic, data)?
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: How are concerns like authentication, networking, and error handling addressed?
- **Build Configuration**: What build configurations and environment management exist?

### 2. State Management Deep Dive
Examine and document:
- **Provider Structure**: How are providers organized and registered?
- **Data Flow**: How does data flow through the application layers?
- **State Persistence**: How is application state managed and persisted?
- **Business Logic Separation**: How is business logic separated from UI logic?

### 3. UI/UX Architecture
Analyze:
- **Component Hierarchy**: How are widgets composed and structured?
- **Design System**: How consistent is the design system implementation?
- **Theme Implementation**: How are themes and styling managed?
- **Accessibility**: What accessibility patterns are implemented?
- **Responsive Behavior**: How does the app adapt to different screen sizes?

### 4. Technical Implementation
Review:
- **Network Layer**: How is API communication structured and managed?
- **Data Models**: How are data models defined and used?
- **File Organization**: How are files organized and imported?
- **Configuration Management**: How are different environments and configurations handled?
- **Platform Considerations**: How are web and mobile platform differences handled?

## Analysis Questions to Address

### Architecture Questions
1. What is the overall architectural pattern of the application?
2. How is separation of concerns implemented across different layers?
3. What design principles are consistently followed throughout the codebase?
4. How modular and maintainable is the current architecture?

### Implementation Questions
1. What state management patterns are used and how effectively?
2. How is the component library (styleguide) integrated with the main app?
3. What are the main data flow patterns in the application?
4. How is error handling and user feedback implemented?

### Quality Questions
1. What is the current test coverage and testing strategy?
2. How well does the code follow Flutter best practices?
3. What performance optimization patterns are implemented?
4. How maintainable and scalable is the current codebase?

### Opportunity Questions
1. What architectural improvements could be made?
2. Where are the main technical debt areas?
3. What patterns could be standardized or improved?
4. What new Flutter features or patterns could be beneficial?
