FLUTTER DEVELOPMENT RULES:

You must develop new UI elements in flutter_styleguide according to flutter_styleguide/README.md rules

run "flutter test" from flutter_styleguide directory when you're changing flutter code and fix issues before you stop with response.

Create golden tests for all new UI elements and review output image result to be sure that you developed UI elements correctly.


Use "temp" folder for temporary scripts
Use "prototyping" folder for prototypes

Commands to execute: "cd flutter_styleguide && flutter run -d chrome --web-experimental-hot-reloadter run -d chrome --web-experimental-hot-reload"

Use README.MD to understand process of development in flutter styleguide.
